for (AI for Bharat)

The Problem: Developers and students face "documentation fatigue," where onboarding into complex, unstructured codebases or technical syllabi is slow, boring, and overwhelming.

The Solution: The Obsidian Ledger is a generative learning framework that transforms static technical data into a procedural, 2D retro-pixel RPG. Using a dual-agent architecture, the Architect Agent parses a local codebase to procedurally generate a spatial "Dungeon of Knowledge," while the Sage NPC Agent acts as an interactive tutor, generating contextual coding puzzles and real-time guidance based directly on the user's files.

The Innovation: Unlike static educational games, our platform is entirely dynamic. By utilizing AI Agents for on-the-fly world-building and tutoring, we turn "reading the README" into an engaging "Level-Up" experience, significantly boosting developer productivity and technical retention.
